Level 2 Python Internship Projects
By Bhumi Jain
Overview
This repository contains the projects completed during Level 2 of my Python internship at Cognifyz Technology. Each project demonstrates practical applications of Python, focusing on enhancing logical thinking, problem-solving, and programming skills
Project List
1. Random Game
Description: A simple game where the program generates a random number, and the user has to guess it.
Features:
Feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
Displays the number of attempts taken to guess correctly.
Key Skills: Random module, loops, conditionals.
2. Random Game Between a Range
Description: An advanced version of the random game where the user specifies a range for the random number.
Features:
Customizable range input.
Validates user inputs.
Key Skills: Input validation, exception handling, loops.
3. Password Validator
Description: Validates user passwords based on predefined criteria.
Features:
Checks for minimum and maximum length.
Validates the presence of uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Provides feedback for invalid passwords.
Key Skills: String manipulation, regular expressions.
4. Fibonacci Series
Description: Generates a Fibonacci sequence up to a user-defined number or term count.
Features:
Two modes: Generate by value or by count.
Recursive and iterative implementations.
Key Skills: Recursion, iterative programming, mathematical logic.
5. Word Frequency Analyzer
Description: Analyzes the frequency of words in a given text.
Features:
Displays the frequency of each word in descending order.
Handles punctuation and case sensitivity.
Key Skills: File handling, dictionaries, text processing.
